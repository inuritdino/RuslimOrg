I. "*Ruslim*" is a combination of two words: "Russian" and
"Muslim". For many people superficially familiar with the meanings
associated with the two words, the term might invoke inconsistent
reactions. But such combination is possible based on *reasonable*
arguments.

Practice demonstrates that the cultural/national boundaries are one of
the main espitemological impediments to knowledge. A set of (known)
mechanisms tends to keep one in his/her cultural environment leaving
almost no room to objectivity. A huge effort is required to surmount
the disincentive of the known. We are *always* deluded by our
culture. At the very least, it leads to ignorance, but in its extreme
it leads to hostility towards others.

II. As this description is intended for non-Russian audience (Russians
are very poor in English on average) it may make even less sense for
the reader analyzing the two connotations. But this is the exact
effect we are looking for.

We see the one world, because we *can* understand each other
unequivocally. Yet we have so many disagreements. Sometime we can
*objectively* justify them, but some other time they are based on no
viable connection to the reality.

III. Finally, the most influential epistemological consequences are
encoded in a number of statements from the Islamic (including Russian)
tradition, including:

> "They listen to the word and take the best of it."

> "Don't they see that the Heavens and the Earth were the one
> inseparable entity, then We have ripped them apart. And We have made
> any single living thing out of water. Can they believe?"

> "Say, travel through the Earth and see how the creation is being
> *started* and then being *repeated*."

> "He showed them their falsehood. They have realized it by saying to
>  each other, we are *deluded*. Yet, they *turned* back to him
>  saying, you just knew it is false [and continued arguing]."

> "And they follow, but theories..."

> "And you see the mountains still, but they *move* as move the
> clouds."

> "I vow by the *places* of the stars
> [which when you see them are no longer where they were]..."

> "We have made the Sun a shining torch and the Moon a [passive] glow."

> "And yet they are playful in doubt..."

> "Fungi are neither plants nor animals..."

> "Every soul shall taste death..."

IV. This resource is about:

- being aware of the delusions and trying to avoid them (I.);
- the methodology to sift knowledge according to its credibility and
  building arguments around the reliable truths (II.)
- comprehensive understanding of things and processes: not **by-many**
  (multi-facted, multi-disciplinary), but **through-many-to-one**
  (trans-disciplinary) (III.).
