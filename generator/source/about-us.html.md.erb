What we know and How we know (it) are the starting points of
the traditional branch of philosophy, so called
epistemology. Seemingly basic this field is beyond grasp of
many people (laymen and intelligentsia alike), which results
in conflicts at the personal and societal levels. Empirical
observations, logic, common sense, necessitated belief and
trustworthiness of its source as well as conditions and
principles governing their interaction may help to avoid
imposed delusions of one's own life and public around.

Therefore, we are trying to address epistemological problems:
i) by consistent processing of the materials pertaining
thereto and ii) in tutorial-like fashion to achieve maximum
practical outcome (thus, adding a new perspective to
epistemology: how do we make use of what we know given how we
know it ). Without constraining ourselves to any particular
methodology, we have developed several own methods, or on-line
practices, by which Ruslim.Org operates, for example,
One-to-all and All-to-one. Many such practices as well as the
broader coverage of the problems require active on-line
community to be part of the process. And we virtually embrace
all new members! (Please, contact us and read For the New
Authors).

matter what evidence is presented to them. Such people are largely
ignored here. We collaborate only with those searching with open eyes
in the world so easily giving ideological nurture to the blind.
