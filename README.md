# RuslimOrg

RuslimOrg repository for the Ruslim.Org project. The new design files are being
kept on GitHub.

Ruslim.Org is a online tutorial on epistemological matters: what we know and how we know it.
We stress, however, a practical implication of mastering epistemology: what are we to do about it?
