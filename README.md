# RuslimOrg repository for the Ruslim.Org project

Ruslim.Org is an online tutorial on epistemological matters: what we
know and how we know it.  We stress, however, a practical implication
of mastering epistemology: what are we to do about it?

Ruslim.Org is supported by a group of professionals seeking the
*reliable* answers to their everlasting questions in order to overcome
the barrier of mental and societal models of the world towards a
slightly more impartial reality.

We are professionals to give others trustworthy information about our
fields of expertise - something we expect from others too.

Finally, we are brave people that challenge established (false)
paradigms to get closer to truth.
