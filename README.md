# RuslimOrg repository for the Ruslim.Org project

Ruslim.Org is an online tutorial on epistemological matters: what we
know and how we know it.  We stress, however, a practical implication
of mastering epistemology: what are we to do about it?

Ruslim.Org is supported by a group of professionals seeking the
*reliable* answers to their everlasting questions in order to overcome
the barrier of mental and societal models of the world towards a
slightly more impartial reality.

We are professionals to give others trustworthy information about our
fields of expertise - something we expect from others too.

Finally, we are brave people that challenge established (false)
paradigms to get closer to truth.

--------

The epistemological tutorial is available directly via GitHub Pages of this
repository (see [gh-pages](https://github.com/inuritdino/RuslimOrg/tree/gh-pages) branch),
that is at: <https://inuritdino.github.io/RuslimOrg>.
The original address <http://ruslim.org>, however, is the primary connection point.

Sincerely,
Ruslim.Org team.
