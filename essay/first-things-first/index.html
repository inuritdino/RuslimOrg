<h3 id="amputation-is-inevitable">Amputation is inevitable</h3>

<p>The patient is losing his limb to gangrene. Amputation is
inevitable. The doctor has it done.</p>

<p>A few months later, the patient sues the doctor for he is responsible
for patient's loss of the limb.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The right thing to do may not be
pleasant.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: When judging an action, look for
possible necessities for it. In this case, ends justify means as
nothing is lost via the means (amputation), except already gangrenous,
whereas the ends bring benefit.</p>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The patient <strong>is</strong> logical in his
arguments!  Unfortunately, being logical is <em>not</em> enough (contrary to
everyday claims, such as: "Please, be logical!", "Let us logically
decompose the argument.", "To defy logic" <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>,
etc…; see also <a href="../../valuable/002-logico-empirical/">Logico-Empirical
chains</a>)</p>

<p>Understanding the problem of <a href="../death/">Death</a> and acting
upon that understanding is that painful amputation needed to remove
gangrenous delusions about life in order to lead a logically congruent
and empirically solid existence.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-no-longer-belief">It is no longer belief</h3>

<p>Once the patient knows their diagnosis, they no longer believe, but
face the truth. Once one faces the truth, they only have a choice:
submit to it or continue as if ignorant of it. One can no longer
justify the actions by saying: "I believe it is true." It is
gangrenous, you know it is. So the choice is yours!</p>

<p>(See also below, <a href="#check-your-world-against-data">when the patient knows not their
diagnosis</a>)</p>

<h3 id="religion-enters-the-stage">Religion enters the stage</h3>

<p>Imagine you are reading a Scripture, your friend passes by and looks
at you with wide open eyes, perplexed by the surrealism of the scene,
almost smiling inside at the simpleton-friend of his who somehow
evaded the achievements of science and the world of high-tech joys,
childish ancient fairy tale lover become you in his eyes, he portrays
you praying to a white-bearded gentleman somewhere on a cloud,
observing cumbersome rituals that lead to neither profit nor bodily
pleasures, so his ego cannot resist to remark: "What are you doing?
And why???"</p>

<p>We started our Tutorial on <a href="../death/">Death</a> using purely
empirical evidence, we continued by necessity arguments and arrived at
beliefs. Many people would start justifying beliefs with other beliefs
only to multiply the arguments. First things first!</p>

<p>What we came to know during this exercise is that if you are concerned
with problems of death and life, you are probably the most sane human
being out there, because you ask questions about the existence itself,
before asking Google about the top 10 places to visit before you
die. So, the question "WHY" should be addressed to those strange
aliens walking on the street, constantly distracted in their gadgets,
and having no clue, although all necessary intellectual instruments to
understand the problem are given to all of them. First things first!</p>

<p>Empirically, it seems that only that vast realm we call religion and
spirituality deals somewhat consistently with
<a href="../death/">Death</a>. Indeed, what else in those vast prairies
of knowledge is but concerned with life and death together. Thus, as
far as these pages are concerned, religion will be defined as one
dealing with the problem of Death <strong>necessarily</strong>. First things first!</p>

<p>And as a consequence of this necessity, it follows that religion must
be conjugate to beliefs associated with things after death (or after
life), which is indeed the case normally (thus, reinforcing the
veracity of our definition). We know that tradition, spirituality,
law, culture are typical lexicon one expects to describe religions. On
contrary, we dare to postulate the very first value of any true
religion: Invariably, religion is what we invoke when we want to
appreciate death, life, after-life, and beliefs. First things first!</p>

<!-- <a name="cor1"></a>**Corollary 1**: One does not have to believe in -->
<!-- everything in any given religion, but religion is not a religion if it -->
<!-- does not deal with Death, Life, Belief. First things first! -->

<h3 id="false-start-when-criticizing-religion">False start when criticizing religion</h3>

<p>Perhaps, due to this perceived understanding of religions in
established terms, the critics of religion stumble time and time again
upon the very same issue: They start their polemic around things
<em>secondary</em> to the main problem.</p>

<p>If religion solves the first problem to be solved, why to criticize
the particulars. Specially, when you cannot come up with a better
alternative of the solution.</p>

<p>They see the dots that sometimes fall off the area of their
understanding (or shall we say desires?), but fail to realize that the
dots are but the tips of the branches all connecting down to the
trunk. Because they see the crown in aerial view over a plane, the
branches appear to be randomly scattered depending on the surrounding
and conditions of the country, but the tree has a 3D structure with
the trunk solid and rooted firmly in one place.</p>

<p>By cutting the branches, they believe to uproot the tree, and this is
only an illusion.</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-religions">Pseudo-religions</h3>

<p>In the vast prairies of former communist countries where atheism was
spread widely, appeared a movement that is genuinely concerned with
Life &amp; Death. They are troubled by the fact that everything goes blank
with death for an individual (<a href="../sheer-void/">Sheer
Void</a>). Luckily, there is this thing called
Evolutionism that postulates that everything is <em>developing</em> and
<em>improving</em>. So we are just cogs and wheels in this huge machinery of
Evolution and when we die we have served our purpose for the best of
the world that continues to evolve <strong>after us</strong> to some distant but
surely worthy goal.</p>

<p>What is problematic with this reasoning? Even after death, it still
connects you with this life we all know. You believe you are gone and
blank, so nothing in this life will be of any concern to you
whatsoever, because there is no <em>you</em>! It could be, however, a valid
<em>purpose</em> in life to contribute to the development of the world while
<em>living</em> (be it even with your own genes, as these adherents may
believe).</p>

<p>Fake religions will have some of the following attributes regardless
of their rhetorical support (Evolution, Scientism, Humanism,
Radicalism…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>They negate the fact of death, by mere rejection of the empirical
evidence: Some believe they will never die or can live forever, both
of which are yet to be shown empirically.</li>
  <li>The aim of their existence is within this life: Death for them is
mere nuisance, not an opening or revelation. It brings them to the
realisation of an end, but logical incapacity turns them back to
life.</li>
  <li>They confuse the purpose in life with the aim of life as defined on
these pages (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#purpose-vs-goal-of-life">Purpose-vs-goal</a>)
— an easily made confusion, unless the terms are rigorously
defined <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, many common people do one of these mistakes when reasoning
about death. But the movements that arise following these mistakes are
many too. Beware fake religions!</p>

<h3 id="cultural-religions">Cultural religions</h3>

<p>This type of religions is not even a religion. If you follow your
forefathers or anyone from your culture without giving slightest
consideration as to why and what for, this is a form of
nationalism/patriotism and ultimately a doomed thing to do.</p>

<p>Verily, if you think that your culture (nation, race, village,
community, ideology or anything like that) is superior to all others,
think about all other cultures (nations, races, villages, ideologies
or anything like that) that thought likewise in history or continue to
think elsewhere on the planet. Their claim is exactly like yours. If
they claim the same and do not understand the superiority of your
culture (that is, no doubt, best for you), what makes you think you
are not falling into the same trap by not understanding them?</p>

<h3 id="starting-wrong-is-in-our-culture">Starting wrong is in our culture</h3>

<p>We call it professionalism. It is that professionalism that is
instilled in our hearts during our upbringing with the aim of getting
a career. Everything in the society is made to promote this highly
tailored set of skills facilitating economical progress of a sort. The
most gifted with skills get all the rewards (Nobel prize, Knighting
and Sir-ing etc.) and sometimes think they can expand their narrow
minded approach beyond the dedicated application area. And Life and
Death are just subjects to these expansion efforts.</p>

<p>In itself, the professionalism is not a bad idea, but it is exactly
when the application is expanded that we see the wrong tool applied to
the problem. The situation is accentuated given the educational system
no longer supports skills needed to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>For example, a simpleton who knows basics in logic would spot these
ill-attempts easily. The good example is attempts by various
professional narrow-minds to define life: "What is Life?" — the book
title that floods the shelves of intellectuals. One time you'll find
on those pages that Life is about existence of protein-based bodies,
some other time that it is a struggle to pass your genes down to your
descendants, yet another – a way to satiate your appetites. Some
books will tell you about intellectual life, others about
artistic. Yet others will tell about life in prison or life in sin, or
life on a deserted island, or life of a civilization. So, our
simpleton, given the same name the authors give to their subject, may
ask "What is the definition of Life, Sir?". Is it that kind of life
when we say "Robert, poor soul, had no life at all!"  or "Magdalena
had a life, full of glory!"?</p>

<p>None of these professionals passes a simple test a common student of a
grammar school should be able to conduct. The implications, it seems,
are numerous, but they are all too dangerous for the societies to
continue this ill-equipped attempts on Life. For one, consider another
simpleton who passes by a book of the sort and becomes curious of the
subject — it is so interesting to know what the progress has brought
in understanding of Life! — only to discover that he is just a
collection of cells that eat, excrete, communicate, and sometimes
rebel against the body. He may also find that his existence is
pointless because passing genes, i.e. having more kids, is not in his
plans.</p>

<p>Will he come across another book with the same name but written by an
astrophysicist or theatrical critic? Maybe. But certainly, he will
exhaust his effort long before he can comprehensively study all of
these narrow-minded attempts on Life.</p>

<p>These authors have their desires above everything else! These authors
are not social beings! These authors deserve isolation in the dark
impenetrable corners of academia! <a href="ref3">[3]</a> They are just
millers who are distracted by the circumstances (see <a href="../../valuable/miller/">Miller
effect</a>).</p>

<h3 id="check-your-world-against-data">Check your world against data</h3>

<p>So far we have been discussing the situations when the gangrene of
life is appreciated. The patient is already with the doctor knowing
his verdict.</p>

<p>What about the patients that have not yet realised their pathology? In
this situation, epistemological methods come into play.</p>

<p>The very basic of them all is to check your world view against
data. When you enter a train, do you not check the destination? When
you enrol in a course, do you not check its objectives? When you buy
shoes, do you not fit them first on your feet? When you have problems
with your hands, does it not make sense to inquire into them and to ask
to see a doctor?</p>

<p>So, why do we not inquire into the most fundamental problem of life
with all our effort? Why do we continue to live as we find appropriate
when the world around us cries incessantly with data about our
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>(P.S. There is always a possibility to choose ignorance at all
cost. Not only can you be ignorant of your gangrene, but you could
care less about treating it. Study the basic reactions to the gangrene
in <a href="../../valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">Four groups by Leo
Tolstoy</a>)</p>

<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>

<p>Clearly, religion is much-much more than the definitions presented in
this study. More yet, I am not even sure we will be using the word
"religion" consistently throughout these pages because all religions,
true or fake, need to be mentioned and because inventing a new word
for our definitions does not seem practical. However, it is important
to understand this quality of "true" religions that deals with the
most basic necessity of life. It is necessary attribute of all
religions, yet far from being sufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, we have yet not said how religion resolves the problem of
death, except that it only appreciates all necessary elements involved
in the problem: life, death, rational existence, necessity of
belief. This, however, requires further studies.</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> Strictly speaking, defying logic invalidates an
argument as logic is a necessary condition, but having a logical
argument does not make it valid, as logic is not a sufficient
condition.</p>

<p><a name="ref2">[2]</a> We do not insist on the terms, but on their
meaning. Their confusion is with the meaning.</p>

<p><a name="ref3">[3]</a> If you wonder why they deserve all of these,
you may want to have a look at <em>The Abolition of Man</em> by C.S. Lewis,
where he argues why these attempts are agenda to rationalize
irrationalizable by following any desire any given moment in history
gives allowance to progress on.</p>

<!-- <a name="ref3">[3]</a> See M. J. Adler and C. van Doren, _How to Read -->

<!-- <a name="ref??"> By this moment, I believe I lost most of the audience -->
<!-- due to their inability to *read* anything "religion". Here what -->
<!-- Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren have to say on this: -->
