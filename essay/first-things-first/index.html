<h3 id="amputation-is-inevitable">Amputation is inevitable</h3>

<p>The patient is losing his limbs to gangrene. Amputation is
inevitable. The doctor has it done.</p>

<p>A few months later, the patient sues the doctor for he is responsible
for patient's losing the limbs.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The right thing to do may not be
pleasant.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: When judging an action, look for
possible necessities dictating it. In this case, ends justify means as
nothing is lost via the means (amputation), except useless
(gangrenous) already, whereas the ends benefit largely.</p>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The patient <strong>is</strong> logical in his
arguments!  Unfortunately, being logical is <em>not</em> enough (contrary to
everyday claims: "Please, be logical!", "Let us logically decompose
the argument.", "To defy logic" <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, etc…; see
also <a href="../../valuable/002-logico-empirical/">Logico-Empirical chains</a>)</p>

<p>Understanding the problem of <a href="../death/">Death</a> is that
painful amputation needed to remove gangrenous delusion about life in
order to lead a logically congruent and empirically solid
existence.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-no-longer-belief">It is no longer belief</h3>

<p>Once the patient knows their diagnosis, they no longer believe, but
face the truth. Once one faces the truth, they only have a choice:
submit to it or continue as if ignorant of it. One can no longer
justify the actions by saying: "I believe it is true." It is
gangrenous, you know it is. So the choice is yours!</p>

<h3 id="religion-enters-the-stage">Religion enters the stage</h3>

<p>Imagine you are reading a Scripture, your friend passes by and looks
at you with wide open eyes, perplexed by the surrealism of the scene,
almost smiling inside at the simpleton-friend of his who somehow
evaded the achievements of science and the world of high-tech joys,
childish ancient fairy tale lover become you in his eyes, he portrays
you praying to a white-bearded gentleman somewhere on a cloud,
observing cumbersome rituals that lead to neither profit nor bodily
pleasures, so his ego cannot resist to remark: "What are you doing?
And why???"</p>

<p>We started our Tutorial on <a href="../death/">Death</a> using purely
empirical evidence, we continued by necessity arguments and arrived at
beliefs. Many people would start justifying beliefs with other beliefs
only to multiply the arguments. First things first!</p>

<p>What we came to know during this exercise is that if you are concerned
with problems of death and life, you are probably the most sane human
being out there, because you ask questions about the existence itself,
before asking Google about the top 10 places to visit before you
die. So, the question "WHY" should be addressed to those strange
aliens walking on the street, constantly distracted in their gadgets,
and having no clue, although all necessary intellectual instruments to
understand the problem are given to all of them. First things first!</p>

<p>Empirically, it seems that only that vast realm we call religion and
spirituality deals somewhat consistently with
<a href="../death/">Death</a>. Indeed, what else in those vast prairies
of knowledge is but concerned with life and death together. Thus, as
far as these pages are concerned, religion will be defined as one
dealing with the problem of Death <strong>necessarily</strong>. First things first!</p>

<p>And as a consequence of this necessity, it follows that religion must
be conjugate to beliefs associated with things after death (or after
life), which is indeed the case normally (thus, reinforcing the
veracity of our definition). We know that tradition, spirituality,
law, culture are typical lexicon one expects to describe religions. On
contrary, we dare to postulate the very first value of any true
religion: Invariably, religion is what we invoke when we want to
appreciate death, life, after-life, and beliefs. First things first!</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: One does not have to believe in
everything in any given religion, but religion is not a religion if it
does not deal with Death, Life, Belief. First things first!</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-religions">Pseudo-religions</h3>

<p>In the vast prairies of former communist countries where Atheism
was/is spread widely, appeared a movement that is genuinely concerned
with Life &amp; Death. They are troubled by the fact that everything goes
blank with death for an individual (<a href="../sheer-void/">Sheer
Void</a>). Luckily, there is this thing called
Evolutionism that postulates that everything is <em>developing</em> and
<em>improving</em>. So we are just cogs and wheels in this huge machinery of
Evolution and when we die we have served our purpose for the best of
the world that continues to evolve <strong>after us</strong> to some distant but
surely worthy goal.</p>

<p>What is problematic with this reasoning? It still connects you with
this life we all know. You believe you are gone and blank, so anything
in this life will be of no concern to you whatsoever, because there is
no <em>you</em>! It could be, however, a valid <em>purpose</em> in life to
contribute to the development of the world while <em>living</em> (be it even
with your own genes, as these adherents may believe).</p>

<p>Fake religions will have some of the following attributes regardless
of their rhetorical support (Evolution, Scientism, Humanism,
Radicalism…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>They negate the fact of death, by mere rejection of the empirical
evidence. Some believe they will never die or can live forever, both
of which are yet to be shown empirically.</li>
  <li>The aim of their existence is within this life. Death for them is
mere nuisance, not an opening or revelation. It brings them to the
realisation of an end, but logical incapacity turns them back to
life.</li>
  <li>They confuse the purpose in life with the aim of life as defined on
these pages (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#purpose-vs-goal-of-life">Purpose-vs-goal</a>)
— an easily made confusion, unless the terms are rigorously
defined <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>

### Critics of religion are many/Wrong start when criticizing religion

So one can compose a library of all those criticisms that religion has
ever made humandkind produce. As in a real war, these points bombard
religion from head to toe: ???

Scarcely, if any, these barking arguments raven the _ab initio_
principle herein described. As with death itself, it is almost
impossible to argue with the first principles, unless madness is the
argument; likewise, religion stays clear of all these assaults in its
very basic ability to satiate human's mind seeking fundamentals,
rather then offshoots.

### Foul start/Miller effect/John Lock's madness
They all start with a wrong end, not even from an end, but in-between

### Professionalism

People are encouraged to get profession and pursue careers. While
there is nothing wrong with that, we must be wary of all biases this
process brings in one's life.

<p><em>(To be continued)…</em></p>

<hr />
<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> Strictly speaking, defying logic invalidates an
argument as logic is a necessary condition, but having a logical
argument does not make it valid, as logic is not a sufficient
condition.</p>

<p><a name="ref2">[2]</a> We do not insist on the terms, but on their
meaning. Their confusion is with the meaning.</p>
