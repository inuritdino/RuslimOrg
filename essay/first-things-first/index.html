<h3 id="amputation-is-inevitable">Amputation is inevitable</h3>

<p>The patient is losing his limb to gangrene. Amputation is
inevitable. The doctor has it done.</p>

<p>A few months later, the patient sues the doctor for he is responsible
for patient's loss of the limb.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The right thing to do may not be
pleasant.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: When judging an action, look for
possible necessities for it. In this case, ends justify means as
nothing is lost via the means (amputation), except already gangrenous,
whereas the ends bring benefit.</p>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The patient <strong>is</strong> logical in his
arguments!  Unfortunately, being logical is <em>not</em> enough (contrary to
everyday claims, such as: "Please, be logical!", "Let us logically
decompose the argument.", "To defy logic" <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>,
etc…; see also <a href="../../valuable/002-logico-empirical/">Logico-Empirical
chains</a>)</p>

<p>Understanding the problem of <a href="../death/">Death</a> and acting
upon that understanding is that painful amputation needed to remove
gangrenous delusions about life in order to lead a logically congruent
and empirically solid existence.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-no-longer-belief">It is no longer belief</h3>

<p>Once the patient knows their diagnosis, they no longer believe, but
face the truth. Once one faces the truth, they only have a choice:
submit to it or continue as if ignorant of it. One can no longer
justify the actions by saying: "I believe it is true." It is
gangrenous, you know it is. So the choice is yours!</p>

<p>(See also below, <a href="#check-your-world-against-data">when the patient knows not their
diagnosis</a>)</p>

<h3 id="religion-enters-the-stage">Religion enters the stage</h3>

<p>Imagine you are reading a Scripture, your friend passes by and looks
at you with wide open eyes, perplexed by the surrealism of the scene,
almost smiling inside at the simpleton-friend of his who somehow
evaded the achievements of science and the world of high-tech joys,
childish ancient fairy tale lover become you in his eyes, he portrays
you praying to a white-bearded gentleman somewhere on a cloud,
observing cumbersome rituals that lead to neither profit nor bodily
pleasures, so his ego cannot resist to remark: "What are you doing?
And why???"</p>

<p>We started our Tutorial on <a href="../death/">Death</a> using purely
empirical evidence, we continued by necessity arguments and arrived at
beliefs. Many people would start justifying beliefs with other beliefs
only to multiply the arguments. First things first!</p>

<p>What we came to know during this exercise is that if you are concerned
with problems of death and life, you are probably the most sane human
being out there, because you ask questions about the existence itself,
before asking Google about the top 10 places to visit before you
die. So, the question "WHY" should be addressed to those strange
aliens walking on the street, constantly distracted in their gadgets,
and having no clue, although all necessary intellectual instruments to
understand the problem are given to all of them. First things first!</p>

<p>Empirically, it seems that only that vast realm we call religion and
spirituality deals somewhat consistently with
<a href="../death/">Death</a>. Indeed, what else in those vast prairies
of knowledge is but concerned with life and death together. Thus, as
far as these pages are concerned, religion will be defined as one
dealing with the problem of Death <strong>necessarily</strong>. First things first!</p>

<p>And as a consequence of this necessity, it follows that religion must
be conjugate to beliefs associated with things after death (or after
life), which is indeed the case normally (thus, reinforcing the
veracity of our definition). We know that tradition, spirituality,
law, culture are typical lexicon one expects to describe religions. On
contrary, we dare to postulate the very first value of any true
religion: Invariably, religion is what we invoke when we want to
appreciate death, life, after-life, and beliefs. First things first!</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: One does not have to believe in
everything in any given religion, but religion is not a religion if it
does not deal with Death, Life, Belief. First things first!</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-religions">Pseudo-religions</h3>

<p>In the vast prairies of former communist countries where atheism
was spread widely, appeared a movement that is genuinely concerned
with Life &amp; Death. They are troubled by the fact that everything goes
blank with death for an individual (<a href="../sheer-void/">Sheer
Void</a>). Luckily, there is this thing called
Evolutionism that postulates that everything is <em>developing</em> and
<em>improving</em>. So we are just cogs and wheels in this huge machinery of
Evolution and when we die we have served our purpose for the best of
the world that continues to evolve <strong>after us</strong> to some distant but
surely worthy goal.</p>

<p>What is problematic with this reasoning? Even after death, it still
connects you with this life we all know. You believe you are gone and
blank, so nothing in this life will be of any concern to you
whatsoever, because there is no <em>you</em>! It could be, however, a valid
<em>purpose</em> in life to contribute to the development of the world while
<em>living</em> (be it even with your own genes, as these adherents may
believe).</p>

<p>Fake religions will have some of the following attributes regardless
of their rhetorical support (Evolution, Scientism, Humanism,
Radicalism…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>They negate the fact of death, by mere rejection of the empirical
evidence: Some believe they will never die or can live forever, both
of which are yet to be shown empirically.</li>
  <li>The aim of their existence is within this life: Death for them is
mere nuisance, not an opening or revelation. It brings them to the
realisation of an end, but logical incapacity turns them back to
life.</li>
  <li>They confuse the purpose in life with the aim of life as defined on
these pages (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#purpose-vs-goal-of-life">Purpose-vs-goal</a>)
— an easily made confusion, unless the terms are rigorously
defined <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, many common people do one of these mistakes when reasoning
about death. But the movements that arise following these mistakes are
many too. Beware fake religions!</p>

<h3 id="cultural-religions">Cultural religions</h3>

<p>This type of religions is not even a religion. If you follow your
forefathers or anyone from your culture without giving slightest
consideration as to why and what for, this is a form of
nationalism/patriotism and ultimately a doomed thing to do.</p>

<p>Verily, if you think that your culture (nation, race, sex or anything
like that) is superior to all others, think about all other cultures
(nations, races, sexes or anything like that) that thought likewise in
history or continue to think elsewhere on earth. If they claim the
same and do not understand the superiority of your culture (that is,
no doubt, best for you), what makes you think you are not falling into
the same trap by not understanding them?</p>

<h3 id="wrong-start-when-criticizing-religions">Wrong start when criticizing religions</h3>

<p>By this moment, I believe I lost most of the audience due to their
inability to <em>read</em> anything "religion". Here what Mortimer J. Adler
and Charles Van Doren have to say on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first mistake is to refuse to accept, even temporarily, the
articles of faith that are the first principles of the author. As a
result, the reader continues to struggle with these first
principles, never really paying attention to the book itself. The
second mistake is to assume that, because the first principles are
dogmatic, the arguments based on them, the reasoning that they
support, and the conclusions to which they lead are all dogmatic in
the same way. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if you are capable of accepting the principles temporarily,
there is still that after taste for religions in the modern man,
unexplained mistrust that has been brewing in him spiced with
achievements of modern science and distancing from classical
education, and deepened by the catastrophic events of the 20th century
in Europe. They start remembering inequalities brought up by the
church, Crusades, fanaticism of all sorts, dishonouring of women,
beheading of the wise and so many other things they were taught to
criticize to illuminate atheism and materialism of their kind.</p>

<p>Yet… First things first! Unfortunately, in all these attempts, they
sue the doctor who is trying to amputate their gangrene.</p>

<h3 id="starting-wrong-is-in-our-culture">Starting wrong is in our culture</h3>

<p>It is called professionalism. It is that professionalism that is
instilled in our hearts during our upbringing with the aim of getting
a career.</p>

<p>So your perplexed friend asking why you are reading a Scripture would
happily understand your answer in line with some professional goals,
such as to promote the career in law (to defend a client based on
their beliefs).</p>

<p><em>(To be continued)…</em></p>

<h3 id="check-your-world-against-data">Check your world against data</h3>

<p>So far we have been discussing the situations when the gangrene of
life is appreciated. The patient is already with the doctor knowing
his verdict.</p>

<p>What about the patients that have not yet realised their pathology? In
this situation, epistemological methods come into play.</p>

<p>The very basic of them all is to check your world view against
data. When you enter a train, do you not check the destination? When
you enrol in a course, do you not check its objectives? When you buy
shoes, do you not fit them first on your feet? When you have problems
with your hands, does it not make sense to inquire into them and to ask
to see a doctor?</p>

<p>So, why do we not inquire into the most fundamental problem of life
with all our effort? Why do we continue to live as we find appropriate
when the world around us cries incessantly with data about our
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>(P.S. There is always a possibility to choose ignorance at all
cost. Not only can you be ignorant of your gangrene, but you could
care less about treating it. See also <a href="../../valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">Four groups by Leo
Tolstoy</a>)</p>

<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>

<p>Clearly, religion is much-much more than the definitions presented in
this study. More yet, I am not even sure we will be using the word
"religion" consistently throughout these pages because all religions,
true or fake, need to be mentioned and because inventing a new word
for our definitions does not seem practical. However, it is important
to understand this quality of "true" religions that deals with the
most basic necessity of life. It is necessary attribute of all
religions, yet far from being sufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, we have yet not said how religion resolves the problem of
death, except that it only appreciates all necessary elements involved
in the problem: life, death, rational existence, necessity of
belief. This, however, requires further studies.</p>

<!---

### Foul start/Miller effect/John Lock's madness
They all start with a wrong end, not even from an end, but in-between

### Professionalism

People are encouraged to get profession and pursue careers. While
there is nothing wrong with that, we must be wary of all biases this
process brings in one's life.
