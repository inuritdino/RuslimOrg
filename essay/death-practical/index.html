<p>Make sure you have read <a href="../death/">Death</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody (living) has experienced the after-death state. Hence,
<em>anything</em> being claimed regarding that belongs to <em>beliefs</em>. No
matter who is claiming: the highest top-scientist Oxford professor
or a ragged gentleman from the corner of the street.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death is central to life, it may be more to life than the life
itself. Ask your epistemology professor why he keeps occupying you
with other irrelevant topics and keeps silent when it comes to death.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the following bias: you can think of many other possible
human beings that may have been born and never were, but every one
that has been born dies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death is not a disease: medical doctors know when it comes and do
not even try to treat the dead human beings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Death is not opposite of life (as some dictionaries might
claim). It is an event of termination of life. The events bringing
(back) one to life could be considered as the opposites of death
(for example, birth).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an extrapolation problem with death too: if you are
alright, you think instinctively (your brain sort of "models" into
the future) that this state will continue… Consider the opposite:
if you feel bad or are ill, it is extremely hard to think positive
and the brain extrapolates negative thoughts into the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Human beings love new, unexplored areas, hence death is boring to
most of the people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people (philosophers and other speculative thinkers of
the modern age) that argue that <em>everything</em> is subjective, that
there is nothing we could know objectively, that our minds do the
tricks cheating us regarding reality. Note that one <em>cannot</em> argue
this with death. Death is objective to everybody, there are no
tricks about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no words suitable to describe death unless you taste it
yourself. But to be prepared for it, you need to be familiar with
it to any degree possible: visit graveyards on any occasion,
seriously ill people (oncological wards), funerals of your
relatives. In any case, you <em>will</em> taste death, but only once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it seems obvious, but you do not have to believe in death
(in the casual sense of the word "believe"). It is an empirical,
trustworthy, escaping the induction problem result:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I may or may not believe that tomorrow there will be a town
 in the sky or the grass will reach the sun in growth, but it
 is impossible to believe or not to believe that tomorrow will
 be today or three will be one and still three. It is obvious
 that the one saying this cannot make it clear or cannot put it
 in a clear way based on what he has (Leo Tolstoy, On the
 Dogmatic Theology).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another delusion which perpetuates this life is: everything is
designed to make you forget the reality of death (school, friends,
first love, career, family, pleasures etc). Just ask yourself how much
time your teachers dedicate to death. If not much, if not even most of
the time, you and your teacher are in delusion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people believe that they will never die. It is the most
unreliable type of belief. It does not come any close to
reality. It is not based on the most reliable empirical evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another group of people thinks that they can extend life to
unreachable time limits (by means, for example, of biological
alterations of aging processes and factors). It is an epistemological
arrogance to suddenly realize that you know more than all of humanity
that lived before you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Everything can be fixed</em> as they say… This does not work with
death. Even if you believe in having several lives, since you do
not have <strong>access</strong> to your previous lives (you do not remember
them), it is absolutely unpractical to think this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without even touching the topic of <em>meaning</em> of any kind (meaning
of life or death): To simply live appreciating the fact that you will
die is an achievement in itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"Truth is relative," the democracy inclined modern thinkers tend
to say. They instill this meaning through their books. Death is
relative: so let them jump from a 100th floor of a building somewhere
in Manhattan and see if the result depends on a person… Yet they
call themselves intellectuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The induction problem is <em>not</em> equivalent to the problem of
death. The induction problem cannot guarantee one tomorrow, or future,
whereas the end-of-life problem indicates you <strong>know</strong> the future,
which is death by any possible or impossible scenario. Both problems
deal with the future. Negligence in both of the problems deludes you
in your present.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(<em>to be continued</em>…)</p>
  </li>
