	  <h2 id="sheer-void-as-belief">Sheer void as belief</h2>

<p>The purpose of the whole life (its goal) is necessarily associated
with a belief as it is apprehended only after death (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#the-end-of-life-and-belief">elsewhere</a>).</p>

<p>But what if I say that my belief about the end of life is sheer void?
What if life has nothing afterwards, nothing tangible after death?</p>

<p>To address this, let us first make an important remark following
general logical considerations.</p>

<p><a name="rem0"></a><strong>Remark 1</strong>: The necessity of belief associated
with the end of life does not equate to having <em>any</em> belief about what
comes after death. This condition, being defined broadly, does not
stipulate presence of inconsistent or wrongly posited beliefs. So
beliefs, although a must in this context, have to be properly defined.</p>

<h2 id="void-after-death-no-goal-of-life">Void after death, no goal of life</h2>

<p>If we assume absolute emptiness and sheer void after death, we have to
necessarily conclude that the goals to be measured up against do not
exist either: Nothing means nothing.</p>

<p>No result of the activity of life can be anticipated with such a
belief. Therefore, this activity becomes without a goal. Any activity
without a goal cannot be called rational.</p>

<p><a name="con0"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The belief in Sheer Void after
death is not rational.</p>

<h2 id="empirical-tests">Empirical tests</h2>

<h3 id="test-1-slap-in-the-face">Test 1: slap in the face</h3>

<p>Imagine now a person confronting you and telling you that they are
believers in sheer void after life. Imagine, too, that you could slap
such a person in the face. What would their reaction be?</p>

<p>Will they respond, for example, in the form of a counter slap or a
curse on your name, or a suit in the court of law?</p>

<p>Any similar-in-kind reaction prompted by the slap would indicate a
liar. Indeed, if they truly believed in sheer void, nothing in this
life would ever be appealing to them, since they would know an
ultimate destroyer of everything of this life,
<a href="../death/">death</a>. They value this life or something in
it, which is altogether inconsistent with the belief in sheer void.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: The true belief in Sheer Void
after death, although irrational (see <a href="#con0"><strong>Conclusion 1</strong></a>),
sometimes may delude. In this case, if an individual under the
delusion values anything or anybody of this life, they behave
irrational (hence, they are doubly irrational in the light of
<strong>Conclusion 1</strong>).</p>

<p>Another type of reaction prompted by the slap can be submission: the
subject of your experiment submits himself to the pain and humiliation
of the ego, he has no reaction to the aggressor, no bad feelings at
all. He lives completely up to the understanding of the problem of
death. But… he has no strength to finish a joke we call life (this
is the solution of "weakness" <a href="../../valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">according to Leo
Tolstoy</a>).</p>

<p>Their misery is understandable, the absurd of their position is
inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="rem1"></a><strong>Remark 2</strong>: There is very little of
black-and-white in matters of belief. For example, people believing in
God commit crimes in sheer contradiction to the divine law. Here, we
enter the realm of compassion and empathy, rather than logical or
empirical. We are not machines and we are weak too… However, the
arguments of this essay concern mainly people pertaining to ardent
opposition of anything believable or going beyond this life, people
who deem themselves super-rational at times and those opposite them
not rational at all…</p>

<h3 id="test-2-inheritance-law">Test 2: inheritance law</h3>

<p>One of the greatest minds in the history of humanity, Al-Ghazali,
gives the following example.</p>

<p>When faced with the question of life and its purpose, people promptly
refer to the greatest of the great: the Ancient Greeks, Romans,
Renaissance, Humanism, Absolutism, Relativism, Rationalism,
Empiricism, Positivism, Darwinism at last. Well, even they have not
concluded anything positive about anything after life, we can but
follow the great minds of humanity.</p>

<p>However, when an ignorant peasant is deprived of inheritance by his
own father and told to believe that his closest next of kin made a
will to give all his possession to an unknown person, this peasant
<strong>seeks the proof</strong>: what did his father write in the will? who were
the witnesses? who was the solicitor? had the solicitor enough
expertise (maybe, even asking another solicitor to double-check)? how
much was granted to that third person? how much did his father have?</p>

<p>But why? This very peasant a minute ago was "stoically" defending the
Ancient Greeks' position on the afterlife?</p>

<p>The answer is very simple. When you are not interested, when something
does not concern you or worse it hampers anything that attracts you,
you invent excuses, you make irrelevant queries and make prompt
inconsistent conclusions. In other words, you renounce your own
intellect. (Al-Ghazali does not even consider the Sheer Void as an
intellectually valid position due to its foundations in desires.)</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: Desires and whims of the ego
(that is, something that strongly interests and attracts you) are the
main barriers to the objective thinking.</p>

<p><a name="ex0"></a><strong>Example 1</strong>: A counter-example for the earlier
peasant could be a highly educated intellectual (e.g., PhD, MD, and
MBA in one person) pondering on the meaning of life with a glass of
Romanée-Conti and a piece of Epoisses de Bourgogne, reciting
effortlessly here and there from Stoics, Plato, Nietzsche, and
Schopenhauer. Desires afflict everyone.</p>
