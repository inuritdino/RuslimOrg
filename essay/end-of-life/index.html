<h3 id="purpose-vs-goal-of-life">1. Purpose vs. goal of life</h3>

<p>The <strong>purpose</strong> of life is a way one should live his life to attain
<strong>a happy life</strong> (without defining the latter). In fact, the
definition of what constitutes a happy life makes difference in what
people consider their personal purposes in life. Example: my purpose
of life is to teach children, to heal people, to become one of the
best surgeons, to earn money for helping people in need, to become a
president.</p>

<p>The <strong>goal</strong> of life, on the other hand, is the final result of one's
life, its outcome, the destination and result of all life's
activities.</p>

<p>According to these definitions, the purpose of life is about the
process, the way we live our lives, whereas the goal of life is for
the end of it.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-the-end">2. Importance of the end</h3>

<p>The end of any activity is the most important as it motivates any
rational being, like humans. For any activity one has to determine
<strong>why</strong> he does that and <strong>what</strong> he is trying to achieve. And this
will be the reason one does something.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get a diploma. If you do
not get the diploma, the mission fails. The idea of getting the
diploma keeps you going towards the goal.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get smarter. If you do not
get the diploma, the mission can be still a success, because you want
eventually to get smarter (regardless of the means you take to measure
smartness).</p>

<p>Why do you go shopping? I want to have bread on my table. If you get a
new pair of shoes, the mission fails, because your goal was to get
some bread.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: deeds are made and measured by
their ends.</p>

<p><a name="rem1"></a><strong>Remark 1</strong>: going outside to have fresh air "out
of sheer idleness" cannot be in essence without the end, because
"having fresh air" is the end in this
situation <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. The sheer idleness would be only
irrational and possible for distracted persons. Same with mere love
for doing something, like painting, woodcarving, playing football,
there will be an end/goal for such activities as well.</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: Any activity ends with its goal
being achieved (perhaps, that is why linguistically end is equal to
goal sometimes).</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life">3. The end of life</h3>

<p>The goal of one's life lies ultimately at its end or beyond,
<a href="../death/">death</a>. The goal cannot be evident before death, that
is while living. Therefore, what sometimes is called the goal of one's
life cannot be considered as such, <em>if it is in principle achievable
during one's life</em>.</p>

<p>To become a president cannot serve as the goal of your life, since if
you become a president, the goal is achieved, but you are still alive
and your life is now without that particular goal, hence it is not the
goal of your entire life.</p>

<p><a name="rem2"></a><strong>Remark 2</strong>: your life may have some smaller
goals which rather relate to the purpose of your life and which can be
achieved through life. However, these cannot be the goal…</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: the goal of one's life is
<strong>beyond</strong> life itself, at very least is at its end,
<a href="../death/">death</a>.</p>

<p><a name="cor2"></a><strong>Corollary 2</strong>: note, that the goal of life
<em>palpably</em> affects the way you live your life, that is your purpose in
life. However, the purpose in life affects what you achieve as its
goal only in belief. In other words, what you consider as a goal for
whole your life will perceptibly change the way you live. But one can
only believe that the way of living will change the ultimate result,
the goal of life (after death).</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life-and-belief">4. The end of life and belief</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A rational being is characterized by justifying any work he does
with the goal he strives for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goal of life lies uncompromisingly beyond life itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything beyond life and its experiences belongs to the realm of
beliefs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: a rational living being <strong>must</strong>
have a belief about the ends a life might have.</p>

<p><a name="cor3"></a><strong>Corollary 3</strong>: empirical evidence is able to
necessitate a belief.</p>

<p><a name="rem3"></a><strong>Remark 3</strong>: Leo Tolstoy in his
<a href="/reading-club/confession-tolstoy">Confession</a> <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
arrives at the similar conclusions epitomized by the following
questions, re-phrases of "the question of life", "the simplest
question lying in the soul of every human being", "the question
without which life is impossible":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will come of what I do today and tomorrow? What will come of my
entire life? Why should I live? Why should I wish for anything or do
anything? Is there any meaning in my life that will not be destroyed
by my inevitably approaching death?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> In reality, one has to determine how much fresh
air he/she is going to have: say, having fresh air for an hour…</p>

<p><a name="ref2">[2]</a> This work is especially valuable as it
summarizes human knowledge on the subject (perhaps, with the stress on
the Western-Christian thought and fairly extensive emphasis on the
Eastern traditions). Tolstoy was not merely speculating, because for
him this question of life became as vital as breathing and eating, and
sleeping.</p>
