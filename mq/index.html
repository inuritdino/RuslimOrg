<h2 id="a-case-for-equality-investigation-in-scientific-research">A case for equality investigation in scientific research</h2>

<p>A case for intentional exclusion of a legitimate author from the
authorship of a scientific publication is being presented. This case
is being presented in hope that it will be instrumental in attempts to
restore justice.</p>

<p>The author in question is <strong>Mohamed El-Qelish</strong> (<strong>MQ</strong>) who was, as
we believe the data on this page demonstrates, illegitimately revoked
his right to the authorship in the scientific work he rightly carried
out. Here, we present a point-by-point evidence in support of his
authentic contribution.</p>

<p>Documents D1 &amp; D2 represent authentic preprint submissions to
scientific journals with <strong>MQ</strong> as a legitimate co-author. D1 &amp; D2
were rejected by the corresponding journals. However, D3 was accepted
and published with much of the same research work initially submitted
as part of D1 &amp; D2 and carried out by <strong>MQ</strong>. Yet D3 excludes <strong>MQ</strong>
from the authorship. Below, we identify such pieces of the original
work that was unlawfully taken from <strong>MQ</strong> without proper authorship
attribution.</p>
