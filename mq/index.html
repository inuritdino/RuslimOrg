<h2 id="a-case-for-equality-investigation-in-scientific-research">A case for equality investigation in scientific research</h2>

<p>A case for intentional exclusion of a legitimate author from the
authorship of a scientific publication is being presented. This case
is being presented in hope that it will be instrumental in attempts to
restore justice.</p>

<p>The author in question is <strong>Mohamed El-Qelish</strong> (<strong>MQ</strong>) who was, as
we believe the data on this page demonstrates, illegitimately revoked
his right to the authorship in the scientific work he rightly carried
out. Here, we present a point-by-point evidence in support of his
authentic contribution.</p>

<h3 id="our-claim">Our claim</h3>
<p>Based on the evidence in this document, we believe that <strong>MQ</strong> was
unjustly deprived of his right to be a legitimate co-author of the
manuscript <strong>D3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="evidence">Evidence</h3>

<h4 id="d3-and-d1d2-contain-similar-research-work">D3 and D1/D2 contain similar research work</h4>
<p>Below we provide some evidence as to show that D1/D2 manuscripts
contain largely the work associated with D3.</p>

<h5 id="fig-2b-in-d3-is-exact-copy-of-fig-2b-in-d1-and-fig-s2-in-d2">Fig. 2b in D3 is exact copy of Fig. 2b in D1 and Fig. S2 in D2</h5>

<p><strong>Fig. 2b</strong> <a href="data/Fig2b_D3.png">(png)</a> in D3 (p. 5 of the
document) is contained unmodified in Fig. 2b of D1 (p. 71,
bottom-right panel) and Fig. S2 of D2 (p. 60, bottom-right
panel). Please, note that the figure attached to this document is
original copy taken from the microscope directly, while those
presented as publication figures in the documents D1, D2, and D3 are
super-position of two images: the original and a technical satellite
picture (black square in the panel). Thus, we provide <a href="data/Fig2b_D3.png">an original
digital image</a> of the figure.</p>

<h5 id="fig-6-in-d3-is-a-copy-of-fig-5-in-d1-and-fig-4-in-d2">Fig. 6 in D3 is a copy of Fig. 5 in D1 and Fig. 4 in D2</h5>

<p>Fig. 6 in D3 (p. 10) is identical to Fig. 5 in D1 (p. 78) and to
Fig. 4 in D2 (p. 46), in that it represents the same data (changes in
the graph decorations can be noticed though). All panels of the figure
are replicated in all three documents.</p>

<h5 id="sec-45-in-d3-exploits-largely-the-same-text-as-sec-331-in-d1-and-sec-321-in-d2">Sec. 4.5 in D3 exploits largely the same text as Sec. 3.3.1 in D1 and Sec 3.2.1 in D2</h5>
<p>Sec. 4.5 of D3 (p. 9) contains almost identical text slightly modified
from the original contributions in Sec. 3.3.1 of D1 (p. 41) and in Sec
3.2.1 of D2 (p. 25).</p>

<h5 id="evidence-above-shows-that-d1-d2-and-d3-contain-identical-research-work">Evidence above shows that D1, D2, and D3 contain identical research work</h5>
<p>Judged by the evidence so far, we can conclude that D1, D2, and D3
submissions contain identical research materials. Thus, it is at least
strange that the author list has undergone a significant change. We
should also conclude that any work built on a previous work must at
least acknowledge the authors of that previous work, henceforth, the
authors, whose work is included into subsequent analysis, should <em>not</em>
be removed, but additional authors are possible (when new analyses are
introduced, for example). <strong>Next, we will provide evidence
demonstrating that MQ indeed had an original research contribution to
D1, D2, and hence D3 works.</strong></p>

<h4 id="mq-provides-raw-data-uniquely-associated-with-d3-published-material"><strong>MQ</strong> provides raw data uniquely associated with D3 published material</h4>
<p>In this section, we provide the raw data coming directly from the
experimental machines. These data are uniquely associated with the
data reported in D3, yet were not provided with the D3 submission
files (basic raw data are usually not part of the journal
submissions).</p>

<h5 id="data-generated-by-mq-was-submitted-to-other-journals-before-d3">Data generated by MQ was submitted to other journals before D3</h5>

<p>Documents D1 &amp; D2 represent authentic preprint submissions to
scientific journals with <strong>MQ</strong> as a legitimate co-author. D1 &amp; D2
were rejected by the respective journals. However, D3 was accepted and
published with much of the same research work initially submitted as
part of D1 &amp; D2 and carried out by <strong>MQ</strong>. Yet D3 excludes <strong>MQ</strong> from
the authorship. Below, we identify such pieces of the original work
that was wrongfully taken from <strong>MQ</strong> without proper authorship
attribution.</p>

<h5 id="lead-researcher-at-asks-mq-to-submit-the-manuscript">Lead researcher <strong>AT</strong> asks <strong>MQ</strong> to submit the manuscript</h5>
<p>Ahmed Tawfik (<strong>AT</strong>) asks <strong>MQ</strong> by email to submit the manuscript
and suggests two journals. One of them is clearly identified as
Journal of Envrionmental Management (D2). Additionally, <a href="data/Email_AT_asks_to_submit.pdf">the PDF
copy</a> of the email contains a
list of attachments corresponding to the original data of the
manuscript.</p>

<h5 id="manuscript-d2-have-mq-as-corresponding-author">Manuscript D2 have <strong>MQ</strong> as corresponding author</h5>
<p>This is evident from the 3rd page of D2, where affiliations of the
authors are stated. Two email addresses for <strong>MQ</strong> are provided as a
contact point.</p>

<h5 id="cover-letter-for-manuscript-d2-was-writtensigned-by-mq">Cover letter for manuscript D2 was written/signed by <strong>MQ</strong></h5>
<p>The cover letter is on page 4 of the original submission of D2.</p>

<h5 id="fig-2b-in-d3-in-original-digital-format">Fig. 2b in D3 in original digital format</h5>

<p>Fig. 2b as printed in manuscript D3 is shown below. Note that the
published figure was modified as to contain the black box in the
upper-right corner. Note also that the aspect ratio of the figure has
been changed for the publication.</p>

<p><img src="data/Fig2b_D3_.png" width="800px" /></p>

<p>Fig. 2b in the original digital format provided by <strong>MQ</strong>. Note this
figure does not contain the black box and retains the 1:1 aspect ratio
which indicates its originality.</p>

<p><img src="data/Fig2b_D3.png" width="800px" /></p>

<h5 id="fig-2c-in-d3-original-machine-data-readout-edx-experiment">Fig. 2c in D3, original machine data readout (EDX experiment)</h5>
<p>Next, we provide the original (EDX) machine readout for the spectrum
shown in Fig. 2c of D3 (p. 5). This readout was not in the submission
of D3, yet the graph was taken out, while the other data of the
readout indicate the original source of the figure. This data sheet
was provided directly by <strong>MQ</strong> and can be downloaded
<a href="&quot;/mq/data/EDX%20of%20Graphene-Hydroxyapatite.docx&quot;">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/mq/data/EDX of Graphene-Hydroxyapatite.jpg" width="800px" /></p>

<h5 id="fig-2d-in-d3-original-machine-generated-graphs-xrd-experiment">Fig. 2d in D3, original machine generated graphs (XRD experiment)</h5>
<p>Original data as generated by the machine for the XRD experiments:
<img src="data/XRD-G-HAP.jpg" width="800px" />
<img src="data/XRD-G-HAP_1.jpg" width="800px" />
<img src="/mq/data/XRD of G-HAP_.jpg" width="800px" />
<img src="/mq/data/XRD of Graphene-Hydroxyapatite.jpg" width="800px" /></p>

<p>In these figures, we see original data as generated by the machine
associated software. Note the user and laboratory name indicating the
original data source. These data were provided by <strong>MQ</strong> and not
available as submission documents for D3..</p>

<h5 id="fig-2e-in-d3-original-machine-generated-graphs-ftir-experiment">Fig. 2e in D3, original machine generated graphs (FTIR experiment)</h5>

<p>Fig. 2e of D3 shows the FTIR experiment. The corresponding,
machine-generated graph of the experiment was provided by <strong>MQ</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="data/FTIR.png" width="800px" /></p>

<p>Raw data for this experiment were also provided by <strong>MQ</strong> (full file
is <a href="&quot;/mq/data/FTIR%20raw%20data.txt&quot;">here</a>):</p>

<p><img src="data/FTIR_orig.png" width="400px" /></p>

<p>The above file again show unique print-out in the header section
corresponding to machine-generated raw files. The header does not
immediately contain the data point of the graph, but rather some
technical information related to the experiment. These files were not
available as the D3 submision.</p>
