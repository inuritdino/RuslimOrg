<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>I. Death is an inevitable outcome of our lives. It is an empirical
experiment with <em>practically</em> 100% yield <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Whoever lives
will die. Death is an event of termination of the physical existence
we know as "biological life". Nobody has ever escaped such a
termination of life — the physical death.</p>

<p>Therefore, death is one of <strong>the most reliable</strong> empirical results. In
its persistence it exceeds many things one considers permanent: The
sun may not rise again tomorrow (induction problem), but we will die.</p>

<p>II. Death is <em>ultimately</em> connected with life. There is no death
without association with life. And although life can be thought of as
eternal (the Hereafter, Paradise), the death comes only when there is
a life, a form of existence. Thus, life is a <em>prerequisite</em> for death,
it is a <em>necessary</em> condition for it.</p>

<p>So "What is life?". It is death. It is not <em>completely</em> death, but it
is <em>necessarily</em> defined by death among other things, and since it
makes life cease, we argue it is the most <em>important</em> part of the
definition. What is your life? It is death. Perhaps, it is not the
first thing coming to one's mind when asked such a question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suffering increases, and before he can turn around the patient
discovers what he already knew: the thing he had taken for a mere
indisposition is in fact the most important thing on earth to him, is
in fact death (Leo Tolstoy, Confession).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="Death: the most significant and reliable epistemological result" src="images/banners/death_full.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>III. So do not waste your time thinking that some idea (technology),
some mere belief will make you unreachable for death. Rather most of
the ideas will vanish with time (another reliable empirical result),
but death will stay. Start thinking already now!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all terminal, the only question is: How much time do we have?
(popular movie).</p>

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> Due to the finite sample it can never reach
100% in theory, but in practice it does.</p>

<h2><a href="essay/miller/">Miller effect</a></h2>

<div class="date">
Date: 31.10.2018
</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>The <strong>miller effect</strong> in reasoning refers to situations when one ("the
miller", see below) replaces the primary question or goal of reasoning
("the mill") with secondary questions and goals ("the river") and
answers the secondary questions or pursues the secondary goals as if
they were primary ("the river is the mill itself") or as if the
primary ones did not exist. The miller effect also creates an illusion
of the answer, definitiveness, and certainty, since something is
really answered. In other words, the miller effect is not
(necessarily) a logical flaw.</p>

<p>This effect is illustrated with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us imagine a man whose only means of subsistence is a mill. This
man, the son and grandson of a miller, knows well by tradition how to
manage all parts of the mill so that it grinds satisfactorily. Without
any knowledge of mechanics he adjusts the machinery as best he can, so
that the flour is well ground and good and he lives and earns his
keep.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But having heard some vague talk of mechanics, he begins to think
about the arrangement of the mill and to observe what makes what turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the mill-stones to the rind, from the rind to the shaft, from
the shaft to the wheel, from the wheel to the sluice, to the dam, and
to the water, he comes to the conclusion that everything depends on the
dam and the river. And he is so delighted by this discovery that
instead of testing the quality of the flour as he used to, and raising
or lowering the mill-stones, clamping them, and tightening or
loosening the belt, he begins to study the river. And his mill falls
quite out of order. People begin to tell him he is making a mistake,
but he disputes this and continues to reason about the river. And he
concerns himself so much and for so long a time with this, and
discusses it so eagerly and hotly with those who point out the mistake
in his way of thinking, that at last he convinces himself that the
river is the mill itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To all proofs of the error of his reasoning such a miller will
reply: 'No mill grinds without water, so to know the mill one must
know how to let the water run, one must know the force of its current
and where it comes from—in a word, to know the mill you must get to
know the river.'</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The miller's argument is logically irrefutable. The only way to
undeceive him is to show him that what is most important in any
argument is not so much the argument itself as the place it occupies,
that is to say, that to think effectively it is essential to know what
one should consider first and what later. He must be shown that a
rational plan of activity differs from an irrational one in that its
elements are arranged in the order of their importance: which should
come first, second, third, tenth, and so on, while irrational plans
lack that sequence. It is also necessary to show him that the decision
of this order is not fortuitous, but depends on the purpose for which
the activity is planned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This ultimate aim also determines the sequence in which the separate
reflections should be arranged so as to be sensible. An argument not
connected with the end in view is absurd, however logical it may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The miller's aim is to grind well, and this aim, if he keeps it in
view, will determine for him the indubitable order and sequence of his
reflections about the mill-stones, the wheel, the dam, and the river.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without such reference to their aim, the miller's reflections,
however fine and logical and beautiful in themselves, will be false,
and, above all, meaningless: they will be like the speculations of
Gogol's Kifa Mokievich, who calculated what the thickness of an
elephant's egg-shell would be if elephants were hatched from eggs,
like birds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And such, in my opinion, are the discussions of our contemporary
science about life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Leo Tolstoy, On Life)</p>

<h2><a href="essay/life-without-goal-test/">No life without end: empirical test</a></h2>

<div class="date">

</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>If there exists a result of the whole life, it became apparent only
outside of the time span between birth and death (in particular, after
life, that is <a href="../death/">death</a>; see in detail <a href="../end-of-life/">End of
Life</a>). Moreover, any reasonable activity,
such as life, must have such a goal, necessarily defined through
belief (<a href="../end-of-life/#importance-of-the-end">Importance of

<p>So, how do they live, those who reckon life as having no ends?</p>

<hr />

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> Note that even if one thinks that life does not
necessarily have a goal, they do it out of belief. In other words,
they believe that life has no goals. Thus, it is <em>a sheer belief</em>, for
example, that there is no life after death.</p>

<h2><a href="essay/end-of-life/">The end of life</a></h2>

<div class="date">

</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">

<h3 id="purpose-vs-goal-of-life">1. Purpose vs. goal of life</h3>

<p>The <strong>purpose</strong> of life is that meaning and significance that a human
being imparts to his life and that influence the way one should live
his life to attain <strong>a happy life</strong> (without defining the latter). In
fact, the definition of what constitutes a happy life makes difference
in what people consider their personal purposes in life. Example: my
purpose of life is to teach children, to heal people, to become one of
the best surgeons, to earn money for helping people in need, to become
a president.</p>

<p>The <strong>goal</strong> of (the entire) life, on the other hand, is the final
result of one's life, its outcome, the destination and result of all
life's activities. This result <em>justifies</em> a human life, motivates a
human being, and tells why and what he/she lives for, what he/she
tries to achieve at the end of life, what he/she <em>strives</em> for.</p>

<p><a name="con0"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: According to these definitions,
the purpose of life is about the process, the way we live our lives,
whereas the goal of life is for the end of it, its final result.</p>

<p><a name="cor0"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: The goal, pursued in life, may
create a purpose in one's life. Similarly, the goal of the entire life
may create a purpose for the whole life.</p>

<p><a name="rem0"></a><strong>Remark 1</strong>: The goal is being defined here
broadly: This is a strife, desire, and yearn after some outcome that is
anticipated in the end of some activity. The purpose of life though
one should understand narrowly here, that is a purpose limited to this
life. At this point, we do not define purpose of (entire) life, as
this will be ultimately connected to the goal of life and, hence,
requires additional analyses, left for the future considerations. Note
also, semantically the word "purpose" may have plenitude of meanings,
including "goal" itself. That is why, we restrict the meaning of these
terms in the given context.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-the-end">2. Importance of the end</h3>

<p>The end of any activity is the most important as it motivates any
rational being, like humans. For any activity one has to determine
<strong>why</strong> he does that and <strong>what</strong> he is trying to achieve. And this
will be the reason one does something.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get a diploma. If you do
not get the diploma, the mission fails. The idea of getting the
diploma keeps you going towards the goal.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get smarter. If you do not
get the diploma, the mission can be still a success, because you want
eventually to get smarter (regardless of the means you take to measure
smartness).</p>

<p>Why do you go shopping? I want to have bread on my table. If you get a
new pair of shoes, the mission fails, because your goal was to get
some bread.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: Deeds are made and measured by
their ends. Some result(s) is anticipated in the end of any activity.</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 2</strong>: Any activity ends with its goal
being achieved or being in principle unachievable (perhaps, that is
why linguistically "end" is equal to "goal" sometimes).</p>

<p><a name="rem1"></a><strong>Remark 2</strong>: Going outside to have fresh air "out
of sheer idleness" cannot be in essence without the end, because
"having fresh air" is the end in this situation. The sheer idleness
would be only irrational and possible for distracted persons. Same
with mere love for doing something, like painting, woodcarving,
playing football, there will be an end/goal for any such activity as
well. This goal justifies the activity, however irrational or personal
it is on a larger scale. This is true for the whole range of other
"instinctive" activities, the goal of which may not be present all the
time or in any particular moment of time in the head of men, but
nonetheless each such activity has its own goal. It is important to
note that the goal does not only exist in a very reasoned activity
(such as goals of a project or educational goals), but also in acts
undertaken on rather subconscious level. In the latter case, the goal
might be an emotional rush, inner feeling, instinct, aptitude or mere
caprice. This is all possible due to different <em>ways</em>, depending on
rational maturity, one justifies his activity. In laboratory
experiments, it has been shown that human beings tend to <em>justify</em>
their actions and name their reasons, even if these actions were
stimulated from outside, for example, using brain stimulation (one
lifts his arm after direct stimulation of his brain, yet the subject
<em>explains</em> why he lifted the arm). Therefore, we justify our actions
that are not even ours.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life">3. The end of life</h3>

<p>The life's goal lies ultimately at its end or beyond,
<a href="../death/">death</a>. Whether the goal is achieved or not cannot be
evident before death, that is while living. Therefore, what sometimes
is called the goal of one's life cannot be considered as such, <em>if it
is in principle achievable during one's life</em>.</p>

<p>To become a president cannot serve as the goal of your life, since if
you become a president, the goal is achieved, but you are still alive
and your life is now without this particular goal, hence it is not the
goal of your entire life.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The goal of one's life is
<strong>beyond</strong> life itself, at the very least is at its end,
<a href="../death/">death</a>.</p>

<p><a name="cor2"></a><strong>Corollary 3</strong>: Note that the goal of life
<em>palpably</em> affects the way you live your life, that is your purpose in
life. However, the purpose in life affects what you achieve as its
goal only in belief. In other words, what you consider as a goal for
whole your life will perceptibly change the way you live. But one can
only believe that the way of living will change the ultimate result,
the goal of life (after death).</p>

<p><a name="rem2"></a><strong>Remark 3</strong>: Your life may have some smaller goals
which rather relate to the purpose of your life and which can be
achieved through life. However, these cannot be the goal…</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life-and-belief">4. The end of life and belief</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A rational being is characterized by justifying any work he does
with the goal he strives for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goal of life lies uncompromisingly beyond life itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything beyond life and its experiences belongs to the realm of
beliefs and tenets, as there is no empirical evidence of anything
beyond death.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 4</strong>: A rational living being <strong>must</strong>
have beliefs about the ends life might have.</p>

<p><a name="cor3"></a><strong>Corollary 4</strong>: Empirical evidence is able to
necessitate beliefs.</p>

<p><a name="rem3"></a><strong>Remark 4</strong>: Leo Tolstoy in his
<a href="/reading-club/confession-tolstoy">Confession</a> <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
arrives at the similar conclusions epitomized by the following
questions, re-phrases of "the question of life", "the simplest
question lying in the soul of every human being", "the question
without which life is impossible":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will come of what I do today and tomorrow? What will come of my
entire life? Why should I live? Why should I wish for anything or do
anything? Is there any meaning in my life that will not be destroyed
by my inevitably approaching death?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> This work is especially valuable as it
summarizes human knowledge on the subject (perhaps, with the stress on
the Western-Christian thought and fairly extensive emphasis on the
Eastern traditions). Tolstoy was not merely speculating, because for
him this question of life became as vital as breathing and eating, and
sleeping.</p>
