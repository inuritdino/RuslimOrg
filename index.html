<div class="date">

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>I. Death is an inevitable outcome of our lives. It is an empirical
experiment with <em>practically</em> 100% yield <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Whoever lives
will die. Death is an event of termination of the physical existence
we know as "biological life". Nobody has ever escaped such
termination of life—the physical death.</p>

<p>Therefore, death is one of <strong>the most reliable</strong> empirical results. In
its persistence it exceeds many things one considers permanent: The
sun may not rise again tomorrow (induction problem), but we will die.</p>

<p>II. Death is <em>ultimately</em> connected with life. There is no death
without association with life. And although life can be thought of as
eternal (the Hereafter, Paradise), the death comes only when there is
a life, a form of existence. Thus, life is a <em>prerequisite</em> for death,
it is a <em>necessary</em> condition for it.</p>

<p>So "What is life?". It is death. It is not <em>completely</em> death, but it
is <em>necessarily</em> defined by death among other things, and since it
makes life cease, we argue it is the most <em>important</em> part of the
definition. What is your life? It is death. Perhaps, it is not the
first thing coming to one's mind when asked such a question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suffering increases, and before he can turn around the patient
discovers what he already knew: the thing he had taken for a mere
indisposition is in fact the most important thing on earth to him, is
in fact death (Leo Tolstoy, Confession).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="Death: the most significant and reliable epistemological result" src="images/banners/death_full.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>III. So do not waste your time thinking that some idea (technology),
some mere belief will make you unreachable for death. Rather most of
the ideas will vanish with time (another reliable empirical result),
but death will stay. Start thinking already now!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all terminal, the only question is: How much time do we have?
(a popular movie).</p>

<h3 id="amputation-is-inevitable">Amputation is inevitable</h3>

<p>The patient is losing his limb to gangrene. Amputation is
inevitable. The doctor has it done.</p>

<p>A few months later, the patient sues the doctor for he is responsible
for patient's loss of the limb.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The right thing to do may not be
pleasant.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: When judging an action, look for
possible necessities for it. In this case, ends justify means as
nothing is lost via the means (amputation), except already gangrenous,
whereas the ends bring benefit.</p>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The patient <strong>is</strong> logical in his
arguments!  Unfortunately, being logical is <em>not</em> enough (contrary to
everyday claims, such as: "Please, be logical!", "Let us logically
decompose the argument.", "To defy logic" <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>,
etc…; see also <a href="../../valuable/002-logico-empirical/">Logico-Empirical
chains</a>)</p>

<p>Understanding the problem of <a href="../death/">Death</a> and acting
upon that understanding is that painful amputation needed to remove
gangrenous delusions about life in order to lead a logically congruent
and empirically solid existence.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-no-longer-belief">It is no longer belief</h3>

<p>Once the patient knows their diagnosis, they no longer believe, but
face the truth. Once one faces the truth, they only have a choice:
submit to it or continue as if ignorant of it. One can no longer
justify the actions by saying: "I believe it is true." It is
gangrenous, you know it is. So the choice is yours!</p>

<p>(See also below, <a href="#check-your-world-against-data">when the patient knows not their
diagnosis</a>)</p>

<h3 id="religion-enters-the-stage">Religion enters the stage</h3>

<p>Imagine you are reading a Scripture, your friend passes by and looks
at you with wide open eyes, perplexed by the surrealism of the scene,
almost smiling inside at the simpleton-friend of his who somehow
evaded the achievements of science and the world of high-tech joys,
childish ancient fairy tale lover become you in his eyes, he portrays
you praying to a white-bearded gentleman somewhere on a cloud,
observing cumbersome rituals that lead to neither profit nor bodily
pleasures, so his ego cannot resist to remark: "What are you doing?
And why???"</p>

<p>We started our Tutorial on <a href="../death/">Death</a> using purely
empirical evidence, we continued by necessity arguments and arrived at
beliefs. Many people would start justifying beliefs with other beliefs
only to multiply the arguments. First things first!</p>

<p>What we came to know during this exercise is that if you are concerned
with problems of death and life, you are probably the most sane human
being out there, because you ask questions about the existence itself,
before asking Google about the top 10 places to visit before you
die. So, the question "WHY" should be addressed to those strange
aliens walking on the street, constantly distracted in their gadgets,
and having no clue, although all necessary intellectual instruments to
understand the problem are given to all of them. First things first!</p>

<p>Empirically, it seems that only that vast realm we call religion and
spirituality deals somewhat consistently with
<a href="../death/">Death</a>. Indeed, what else in those vast prairies
of knowledge is but concerned with life and death together. Thus, as
far as these pages are concerned, religion will be defined as one
dealing with the problem of Death <strong>necessarily</strong>. First things first!</p>

<p>And as a consequence of this necessity, it follows that religion must
be conjugate to beliefs associated with things after death (or after
life), which is indeed the case normally (thus, reinforcing the
veracity of our definition). We know that tradition, spirituality,
law, culture are typical lexicon one expects to describe religions. On
contrary, we dare to postulate the very first value of any true
religion: Invariably, religion is what we invoke when we want to
appreciate death, life, after-life, and beliefs. First things first!</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: One does not have to believe in
everything in any given religion, but religion is not a religion if it
does not deal with Death, Life, Belief. First things first!</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-religions">Pseudo-religions</h3>

<p>In the vast prairies of former communist countries where atheism
was spread widely, appeared a movement that is genuinely concerned
with Life &amp; Death. They are troubled by the fact that everything goes
blank with death for an individual (<a href="../sheer-void/">Sheer
Void</a>). Luckily, there is this thing called
Evolutionism that postulates that everything is <em>developing</em> and
<em>improving</em>. So we are just cogs and wheels in this huge machinery of
Evolution and when we die we have served our purpose for the best of
the world that continues to evolve <strong>after us</strong> to some distant but
surely worthy goal.</p>

<p>What is problematic with this reasoning? Even after death, it still
connects you with this life we all know. You believe you are gone and
blank, so nothing in this life will be of any concern to you
whatsoever, because there is no <em>you</em>! It could be, however, a valid
<em>purpose</em> in life to contribute to the development of the world while
<em>living</em> (be it even with your own genes, as these adherents may
believe).</p>

<p>Fake religions will have some of the following attributes regardless
of their rhetorical support (Evolution, Scientism, Humanism,
Radicalism…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>They negate the fact of death, by mere rejection of the empirical
evidence: Some believe they will never die or can live forever, both
of which are yet to be shown empirically.</li>
  <li>The aim of their existence is within this life: Death for them is
mere nuisance, not an opening or revelation. It brings them to the
realisation of an end, but logical incapacity turns them back to
life.</li>
  <li>They confuse the purpose in life with the aim of life as defined on
these pages (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#purpose-vs-goal-of-life">Purpose-vs-goal</a>)
— an easily made confusion, unless the terms are rigorously
defined <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, many common people do one of these mistakes when reasoning
about death. But the movements that arise following these mistakes are
many too. Beware fake religions!</p>

<h3 id="cultural-religions">Cultural religions</h3>

<p>This type of religions is not even a religion. If you follow your
forefathers or anyone from your culture without giving slightest
consideration as to why and what for, this is a form of
nationalism/patriotism and ultimately a doomed thing to do.</p>

<p>Verily, if you think that your culture (nation, race, sex or anything
like that) is superior to all others, think about all other cultures
(nations, races, sexes or anything like that) that thought likewise in
history or continue to think elsewhere on earth. If they claim the
same and do not understand the superiority of your culture (that is,
no doubt, best for you), what makes you think you are not falling into
the same trap by not understanding them?</p>

<h3 id="wrong-start-when-criticizing-religions">Wrong start when criticizing religions</h3>

<p>By this moment, I believe I lost most of the audience due to their
inability to <em>read</em> anything "religion". Here what Mortimer J. Adler
and Charles Van Doren have to say on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first mistake is to refuse to accept, even temporarily, the
articles of faith that are the first principles of the author. As a
result, the reader continues to struggle with these first
principles, never really paying attention to the book itself. The
second mistake is to assume that, because the first principles are
dogmatic, the arguments based on them, the reasoning that they
support, and the conclusions to which they lead are all dogmatic in
the same way. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if you are capable of accepting the principles temporarily,
there is still that after taste for religions in the modern man,
unexplained mistrust that has been brewing in him spiced with
achievements of modern science and distancing from classical
education, and deepened by the catastrophic events of the 20th century
in Europe. They start remembering inequalities brought up by the
church, Crusades, fanaticism of all sorts, dishonouring of women,
beheading of the wise and so many other things they were taught to
criticize to illuminate atheism and materialism of their kind.</p>

<p>Yet… First things first! Unfortunately, in all these attempts, they
sue the doctor who is trying to amputate their gangrene.</p>

<h3 id="starting-wrong-is-in-our-culture">Starting wrong is in our culture</h3>

<p>It is called professionalism. It is that professionalism that is
instilled in our hearts during our upbringing with the aim of getting
a career.</p>

<p>So your perplexed friend asking why you are reading a Scripture would
happily understand your answer in line with some professional goals,
such as to promote the career in law (to defend a client based on
their beliefs).</p>

<p><em>(To be continued)…</em></p>

<h3 id="check-your-world-against-data">Check your world against data</h3>

<p>So far we have been discussing the situations when the gangrene of
life is appreciated. The patient is already with the doctor knowing
his verdict.</p>

<p>What about the patients that have not yet realised their pathology? In
this situation, epistemological methods come into play.</p>

<p>The very basic of them all is to check your world view against
data. When you enter a train, do you not check the destination? When
you enrol in a course, do you not check its objectives? When you buy
shoes, do you not fit them first on your feet? When you have problems
with your hands, does it not make sense to inquire into them and to ask
to see a doctor?</p>

<p>So, why do we not inquire into the most fundamental problem of life
with all our effort? Why do we continue to live as we find appropriate
when the world around us cries incessantly with data about our
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>(P.S. There is always a possibility to choose ignorance at all
cost. Not only can you be ignorant of your gangrene, but you could
care less about treating it. See also <a href="../../valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">Four groups by Leo
Tolstoy</a>)</p>

<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>

<p>Clearly, religion is much-much more than the definitions presented in
this study. More yet, I am not even sure we will be using the word
"religion" consistently throughout these pages because all religions,
true or fake, need to be mentioned and because inventing a new word
for our definitions does not seem practical. However, it is important
to understand this quality of "true" religions that deals with the
most basic necessity of life. It is necessary attribute of all
religions, yet far from being sufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, we have yet not said how religion resolves the problem of
death, except that it only appreciates all necessary elements involved
in the problem: life, death, rational existence, necessity of
belief. This, however, requires further studies.</p>

### Foul start/Miller effect/John Lock's madness
They all start with a wrong end, not even from an end, but in-between

### Professionalism

People are encouraged to get profession and pursue careers. While
there is nothing wrong with that, we must be wary of all biases this
process brings in one's life.

<h2><a href="valuable/miller/">Miller effect</a></h2>

<div class="date">
Date: 31.10.2018
</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>The <strong>miller effect</strong> in reasoning refers to situations when one ("the
miller", see below) replaces the primary question or goal of reasoning
("the mill") with secondary questions and goals ("the river") and
answers the secondary questions or pursues the secondary goals as if
they were primary ("the river is the mill itself") or as if the
primary ones did not exist. The miller effect also creates an illusion
of the answer, definitiveness, and certainty, since something is
really answered. In other words, the miller effect is not
(necessarily) a logical flaw.</p>

<p>This effect is illustrated with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us imagine a man whose only means of subsistence is a mill. This
man, the son and grandson of a miller, knows well by tradition how to
manage all parts of the mill so that it grinds satisfactorily. Without
any knowledge of mechanics he adjusts the machinery as best he can, so
that the flour is well ground and good and he lives and earns his
keep.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But having heard some vague talk of mechanics, he begins to think
about the arrangement of the mill and to observe what makes what turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the mill-stones to the rind, from the rind to the shaft, from
the shaft to the wheel, from the wheel to the sluice, to the dam, and
to the water, he comes to the conclusion that everything depends on the
dam and the river. And he is so delighted by this discovery that
instead of testing the quality of the flour as he used to, and raising
or lowering the mill-stones, clamping them, and tightening or
loosening the belt, he begins to study the river. And his mill falls
quite out of order. People begin to tell him he is making a mistake,
but he disputes this and continues to reason about the river. And he
concerns himself so much and for so long a time with this, and
discusses it so eagerly and hotly with those who point out the mistake
in his way of thinking, that at last he convinces himself that the
river is the mill itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To all proofs of the error of his reasoning such a miller will
reply: 'No mill grinds without water, so to know the mill one must
know how to let the water run, one must know the force of its current
and where it comes from—in a word, to know the mill you must get to
know the river.'</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The miller's argument is logically irrefutable. The only way to
undeceive him is to show him that what is most important in any
argument is not so much the argument itself as the place it occupies,
that is to say, that to think effectively it is essential to know what
one should consider first and what later. He must be shown that a
rational plan of activity differs from an irrational one in that its
elements are arranged in the order of their importance: which should
come first, second, third, tenth, and so on, while irrational plans
lack that sequence. It is also necessary to show him that the decision
of this order is not fortuitous, but depends on the purpose for which
the activity is planned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This ultimate aim also determines the sequence in which the separate
reflections should be arranged so as to be sensible. An argument not
connected with the end in view is absurd, however logical it may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The miller's aim is to grind well, and this aim, if he keeps it in
view, will determine for him the indubitable order and sequence of his
reflections about the mill-stones, the wheel, the dam, and the river.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without such reference to their aim, the miller's reflections,
however fine and logical and beautiful in themselves, will be false,
and, above all, meaningless: they will be like the speculations of
Gogol's Kifa Mokievich, who calculated what the thickness of an
elephant's egg-shell would be if elephants were hatched from eggs,
like birds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And such, in my opinion, are the discussions of our contemporary
science about life.</p>

<h2><a href="essay/sheer-void/">Sheer Void</a></h2>

<div class="date">
Date: 3.1.2022
</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<h2 id="sheer-void-as-belief">Sheer void as belief</h2>

<p>The purpose of the whole life (its goal) is necessarily associated
with a belief as it is apprehended only after death (see
<a href="../end-of-life/#the-end-of-life-and-belief">elsewhere</a>).</p>

<p>But what if I say that my belief about the end of life is sheer void?
What if life has nothing afterwards, nothing tangible after death?</p>

<p>To address this, let us first make an important remark following
general logical considerations.</p>

<p><a name="rem0"></a><strong>Remark 1</strong>: The necessity of belief associated
with the end of life does not equate to having <em>any</em> belief about what
comes after death. This condition, being defined broadly, does not
stipulate presence of inconsistent or wrongly posited beliefs. So
beliefs, although a must in this context, have to be properly defined.</p>

<h2 id="void-after-death-no-goal-of-life">Void after death, no goal of life</h2>

<p>If we assume absolute emptiness and sheer void after death, we have to
necessarily conclude that the goals to be measured up against do not
exist either: Nothing means nothing.</p>

<p>No result of the activity of life can be anticipated with such a
belief. Therefore, this activity becomes without a goal. Any activity
without a goal cannot be called rational.</p>

<p><a name="con0"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: The belief in Sheer Void after
death is not rational.</p>

<h2 id="empirical-tests">Empirical tests</h2>

<h3 id="test-1-slap-in-the-face">Test 1: slap in the face</h3>

<p>Imagine now a person confronting you and telling you that they are
believers in sheer void after life. Imagine, too, that you could slap
such a person in the face. What would their reaction be?</p>

<p>Will they respond, for example, in the form of a counter slap or a
curse on your name, or a suit in the court of law?</p>

<p>Any similar-in-kind reaction prompted by the slap would indicate a
liar. Indeed, if they truly believed in sheer void, nothing in this
life would ever be appealing to them, since they would know an
ultimate destroyer of everything of this life,
<a href="../death/">death</a>. They value this life or something in
it, which is altogether inconsistent with the belief in sheer void.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: The true belief in Sheer Void
after death, although irrational (see <a href="#con0"><strong>Conclusion 1</strong></a>),
sometimes may delude. In this case, if an individual under the
delusion values anything or anybody of this life, they behave
irrational (hence, they are doubly irrational in the light of
<strong>Conclusion 1</strong>).</p>

<p>Another type of reaction prompted by the slap can be submission: the
subject of your experiment submits himself to the pain and humiliation
of the ego, he has no reaction to the aggressor, no bad feelings at
all. He lives completely up to the understanding of the problem of
death. But… he has no strength to finish a joke we call life (this
is the solution of "weakness" <a href="../../valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">according to Leo
Tolstoy</a>).</p>

<p>Their misery is understandable, the absurd of their position is
inevitable.</p>

<p><a name="rem1"></a><strong>Remark 2</strong>: There is very little of
black-and-white in matters of belief. For example, people believing in
God commit crimes in sheer contradiction to the divine law. Here, we
enter the realm of compassion and empathy, rather than logical or
empirical. We are not machines and we are weak too… However, the
arguments of this essay concern mainly people pertaining to ardent
opposition of anything believable or going beyond this life, people
who deem themselves super-rational at times and those opposite them
not rational at all…</p>

<h3 id="test-2-inheritance-law">Test 2: inheritance law</h3>

<p>One of the greatest minds in the history of humanity, Al-Ghazali,
gives the following example.</p>

<p>When faced with the question of life and its purpose, people promptly
refer to the greatest of the great: the Ancient Greeks, Romans,
Renaissance, Humanism, Absolutism, Relativism, Rationalism,
Empiricism, Positivism, Darwinism at last. Well, even they have not
concluded anything positive about anything after life, we can but
follow the great minds of humanity.</p>

<p>However, when an ignorant peasant is deprived of inheritance by his
own father and told to believe that his closest next of kin made a
will to give all his possession to an unknown person, this peasant
<strong>seeks the proof</strong>: what did his father write in the will? who were
the witnesses? who was the solicitor? had the solicitor enough
expertise (maybe, even asking another solicitor to double-check)? how
much was granted to that third person? how much did his father have?</p>

<p>But why? This very peasant a minute ago was "stoically" defending the
Ancient Greeks' position on the afterlife?</p>

<p>The answer is very simple. When you are not interested, when something
does not concern you or worse it hampers anything that attracts you,
you invent excuses, you make irrelevant queries and make prompt
inconsistent conclusions. In other words, you renounce your own
intellect. (Al-Ghazali does not even consider the Sheer Void as an
intellectually valid position due to its foundations in desires.)</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: Desires and whims of the ego
(that is, something that strongly interests and attracts you) are the
main barriers to the objective thinking.</p>

<p><a name="ex0"></a><strong>Example 1</strong>: A counter-example for the earlier
peasant could be a highly educated intellectual (e.g., PhD, MD, and
MBA in one person) pondering on the meaning of life with a glass of
Romanée-Conti and a piece of Epoisses de Bourgogne, reciting
effortlessly here and there from Stoics, Plato, Nietzsche, and
Schopenhauer. Desires afflict everyone.</p>

<h2><a href="essay/end-of-life/">The end of life</a></h2>

<div class="date">
Date: 28.09.2018
</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">

<h3 id="purpose-vs-goal-of-life">1. Purpose vs. goal of life</h3>

<p>The <strong>purpose</strong> of life is that meaning and significance that a human
being imparts to his life and that influence the way one should live
his life to attain <strong>a happy life</strong> (without defining the latter). In
fact, the definition of what constitutes a happy life makes difference
in what people consider their personal purposes in life. Example: my
purpose of life is to teach children, to heal people, to become one of
the best surgeons, to earn money for helping people in need, to become
a president.</p>

<p>The <strong>goal</strong> of (the entire) life, on the other hand, is the final
result of one's life, its outcome, the destination and result of all
life's activities. This result <em>justifies</em> a human life, motivates a
human being, and tells why and what he/she lives for, what he/she
tries to achieve at the end of life, what he/she <em>strives</em> for.</p>

<p><a name="con0"></a><strong>Conclusion 1</strong>: According to these definitions,
the purpose of life is about the process, the way we live our lives,
whereas the goal of life is for the end of it, its final result.</p>

<p><a name="cor0"></a><strong>Corollary 1</strong>: The goal, pursued in life, may
create a purpose in one's life. Similarly, the goal of the entire life
may create a purpose for the whole life.</p>

<p><a name="rem0"></a><strong>Remark 1</strong>: The goal is being defined here
broadly: This is a strife, desire, and yearn after some outcome that is
anticipated in the end of some activity. The purpose of life though
one should understand narrowly here, that is a purpose limited to this
life. At this point, we do not define purpose of (entire) life, as
this will be ultimately connected to the goal of life and, hence,
requires additional analyses, left for the future considerations. Note
also, semantically the word "purpose" may have plenitude of meanings,
including "goal" itself. That is why, we restrict the meaning of these
terms in the given context.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-the-end">2. Importance of the end</h3>

<p>The end of any activity is the most important as it motivates any
rational being, like humans. For any activity one has to determine
<strong>why</strong> he does that and <strong>what</strong> he is trying to achieve. And this
will be the reason one does something.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get a diploma. If you do
not get the diploma, the mission fails. The idea of getting the
diploma keeps you going towards the goal.</p>

<p>Why do you go to the university? I want to get smarter. If you do not
get the diploma, the mission can be still a success, because you want
eventually to get smarter (regardless of the means you take to measure
smartness).</p>

<p>Why do you go shopping? I want to have bread on my table. If you get a
new pair of shoes, the mission fails, because your goal was to get
some bread.</p>

<p><a name="con1"></a><strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: Deeds are made and measured by
their ends. Some result(s) is anticipated in the end of any activity.</p>

<p><a name="cor1"></a><strong>Corollary 2</strong>: Any activity ends with its goal
being achieved or being in principle unachievable (perhaps, that is
why linguistically "end" is equal to "goal" sometimes).</p>

<p><a name="rem1"></a><strong>Remark 2</strong>: Going outside to have fresh air "out
of sheer idleness" cannot be in essence without an end, because
"having fresh air" is the end in this situation. The sheer idleness
would be only irrational and possible for distracted persons. Same
with mere love for doing something, like painting, woodcarving,
playing football, there will be an end/goal for any such activity as
well. This goal justifies the activity, however irrational or personal
it is on a larger scale. This is true for the whole range of other
"instinctive" activities, the goal of which may not be present all the
time or in any particular moment of time in the head of men, but
nonetheless each such activity has its own goal. It is important to
note that the goal does not only exist in a very reasoned activity
(such as goals of a project or educational goals), but also in acts
undertaken rather subconsciously. In the latter case, the goal might
be motivated by an emotional rush, inner feeling, instinct, aptitude
or mere caprice, all of them having a goal defined sensibly or
otherwise. In laboratory experiments, it was shown that human beings
tend to <em>justify</em> their actions and name their reasons, even if these
actions were stimulated from outside, for example, using brain
stimulation (one lifts his arm after direct stimulation of his brain,
yet the subject <em>explains</em> why he lifted the arm). Therefore, we
justify our actions that are not even ours.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life">3. The end of life</h3>

<p>The life's goal lies ultimately at its end or beyond,
<a href="../death/">death</a>. Whether the goal is achieved or not cannot be
evident before death, that is while living. Therefore, what sometimes
is called the goal of one's life cannot be considered as such, <em>if it
is in principle achievable during one's life</em>.</p>

<p>To become a president cannot serve as the goal of your life, since if
you become a president, the goal is achieved, but you are still alive
and your life is now without this particular goal, hence it is not the
goal of your entire life.</p>

<p><a name="con2"></a><strong>Conclusion 3</strong>: The goal of one's life is
<strong>beyond</strong> life itself, at the very least is at its end,
<a href="../death/">death</a>.</p>

<p><a name="cor2"></a><strong>Corollary 3</strong>: Note that the goal of life
<em>palpably</em> affects the way you live your life, that is your purpose in
life. However, the purpose in life affects what you achieve as its
goal only in belief. In other words, what you consider as a goal for
whole your life will perceptibly change the way you live. But one can
only believe that the way of living will change the ultimate result,
the goal of life (after death).</p>

<p><a name="rem2"></a><strong>Remark 3</strong>: Your life may have some smaller goals
which rather relate to the purpose of your life and which can be
achieved through life. However, these cannot be the goal…</p>

<h3 id="the-end-of-life-and-belief">4. The end of life and belief</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A rational being is characterized by justifying any work he does
with the goal he strives for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goal of life lies uncompromisingly beyond life itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything beyond life and its experiences belongs to the realm of
beliefs and tenets, as there is no empirical evidence of anything
beyond death.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a name="con3"></a><strong>Conclusion 4</strong>: A rational living being <strong>must</strong>
have beliefs about the ends life might have.</p>

<p><a name="cor3"></a><strong>Corollary 4</strong>: Empirical evidence is able to
necessitate beliefs.</p>

<p><a name="rem3"></a><strong>Remark 4</strong>: Leo Tolstoy in his
<a href="/reading-club/confession-tolstoy">Confession</a> <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
arrives at the similar conclusions epitomized by the following
questions, re-phrases of "the question of life", "the simplest
question lying in the soul of every human being", "the question
without which life is impossible":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will come of what I do today and tomorrow? What will come of my
entire life? Why should I live? Why should I wish for anything or do
anything? Is there any meaning in my life that will not be destroyed
by my inevitably approaching death?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> This work is especially valuable as it
summarizes human knowledge on the subject (perhaps, with the stress on
the Western-Christian thought and fairly extensive emphasis on the
Eastern traditions). Tolstoy was not merely speculating, because for
him this question of life became as vital as breathing and eating, and
sleeping.</p>

<h2><a href="valuable/four-categories-tolstoy/">The four categories (according to Tolstoy)</a></h2>

<div class="date">
Date: 7.11.2021
</div>

<div class="summary" style="max-height: 200px;">
<p>If there exists a result of the whole life, it becomes apparent only
outside of the time span between birth and death (in particular, after
life, that is <a href="../../essay/death/">death</a>; see in detail <a href="../../essay/end-of-life/">End of
Life</a>). Moreover, any reasonable activity,
such as life, must have such a goal, necessarily defined through
belief (<a href="../../essay/end-of-life/#importance-of-the-end">Importance of
goal</a> and <a href="../../essay/end-of-life/#the-end-of-life-and-belief">End of life
and belief</a>) <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>So, how do they live, those who reckon life as having no ends? Is
there any reasonable activity throughout life that justifies it given
its imminent destruction?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason some people continue to live denying the necessity
to acknowledge <em>anything live after death</em>, these reasons cannot be
but absurd and sheer illogic (see in detail <a href="../../essay/end-of-life/">End of
Life</a>.</p>

<p>Here, we put some <strong>popular</strong> views on the subject for the sake of
example. These examples highlight the general rules derived from the
simple fact of <a href="../../essay/death/">death</a> and serve as generalizations
more or less common universally throughout cultures and ages.</p>

<p>Leo Tolstoy <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> puts the following four categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ignorance</strong>. This does not even realize the question of life.</li>
  <li><strong>Epicureanism</strong>. This realizes hopelessness of life and tries to
 enjoy all the blessings we have without asking <em>where to</em> and
 <em>what for</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Weakness</strong>. This realizes the question but waits. It does not
have enough strength to act rationally.</li>
  <li><strong>Strength</strong>. This realizes the question and chooses
death. Unusually strong and logically consistent people choose this
path.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is obvious that <strong>weakness</strong> as well as <strong>strength</strong> solve the
problem logically correctly, <em>if one does not assume or believe in
the ends after life</em>. The only difference is in practical consistency,
rather than in the intellectual honesty.</p>

<p>It is true further that ignorance does not see the problem and ignores
it (see also <a href="#note1">Note 1</a> below).</p>

<p>Therefore, only Epicureanism is seemingly happy with life, but is it
logically so? Can we call it rational?</p>

<p>The <strong>true epicureanism</strong> tries to enjoy <em>everything</em> it does. In this
case, pleasure is the aim of every activity in life and cannot be the
aim of the whole life (as <a href="../../essay/end-of-life/#importance-of-the-end">shown
before</a>). However, if
the maximal enjoyment is the goal of the whole life, then this
conclusion must be justified by means of beliefs (<a href="../../essay/end-of-life/#the-end-of-life-and-belief">see
earlier</a>), because
whether one succeeded in having maximal pleasure of life or not is to
be known after life, earliest at death. Therefore, the true
epicureanism either <em>believes</em> in <em>something after life</em>, or falls
into ignorance about the question of life and thus becomes illogical.</p>

<p><a name="note1"></a><strong>Note 1</strong>: More recently, there is a movement of
"positive thought" which holds that if you think positively ignoring
negative thoughts, such as thoughts about diseases, bad luck,
failures, you will be safe from them. Naturally, such positive
thinking extends to death, yet <strong>empirically</strong> whether one thinks or
not about it, death reaches everyone.</p>

<hr />

<p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> Note that even if one thinks that life does not
necessarily have a goal, they do it out of belief. In other words,
they believe that life has no goals. Thus, it is <em>a sheer belief</em>, for
example, that there is no life after death.</p>
